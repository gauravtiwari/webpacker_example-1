# Issues

You can switch between webpack/sprockets for javascript by commenting/uncommenting in `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`.

**1) Turbolinks not working**
-> links embedded in views

**2) jQuery not working**
-> Doing simple things like `$('body').hide();` throws an error.

**3) actioncable not working**
-> console errors
